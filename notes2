## Cognitive Biases

### Too much information

### Not enough meaning
- Outcome bias -
- Bandwagon effect -

### Exploiting Bias in the workplace

- Reactance - By telling people they are able to say no will make them more likely to say yes
- Reciprocity - Be the first to give
- Door in the face - Forcing people to refuse a large offer that increases the likelihood of agreeing to a second, smaller request
- Likability - Give compliments and build cooperation
- The bystander effect - people look to others to determine their own actions
