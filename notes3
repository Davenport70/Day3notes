### Structure!! Plan and structure what you will do

- Go into each section and discuss: lead in, content (rule of 3), summary review
- Conclude and talk about what you have done

### If you are presenting:
- Understand your audience
- Keep it simple (KISS)
- Your slides are an aid, not the end product.
- Use notes
- Use diagram and images appropriately

#### Have an angle
- don’t make it general. Talk about a specific thing and apply it. If it it music don’t just talk about music,
example: talk about the 3 ways music has affected you.
